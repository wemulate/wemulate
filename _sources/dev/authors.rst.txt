WEmulate was initially developed as a student project at the `Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences <https://ost.ch>`_ in Rapperswil.  
  
Through the need of a new solution to replace old lab environment hardware, WEmulate will be developed further through members of the `Institute for Networked Solutions <https://ins.hsr.ch>`_. 

Current Contributors are: `Severin <https://github.com/severindellsperger>`_ , `Julian <https://github.com/jklaiber>`_ and `Fabian <https://github.com/DNS320>`_
